**Turn every git commit into a slot machine pull!**

A fun CLI tool that analyzes your commit hashes and rewards you based on patterns found in the first 7 hex characters. Automatically plays after each commit via a post-commit hook, syncs with a global leaderboard, and tracks your stats across all your repos.

## Winning Patterns & Payouts

Every commit costs **10 points**. You start with **100 points**.

| Pattern | Example | Payout | Probability | Expected Value | ROI per Win | Description |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|

## Statistics & Probabilities

For the nerds who love the math:

### Win Rate Analysis

| Category | Percentage | Expected Value |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Total Win Rate** | ~65% | Positive EV |
| **No Win Rate** | ~35% | -10 points |
| **Profit Rate** | ~61% | Positive return |
| **Break Even Rate** | ~3.7% | 0 net (all numbers) |

### Pattern Rarity Tiers

**Legendary (Once in a lifetime):**
- JACKPOT, HEXTET, LUCKY SEVEN

**Epic (Very rare):**
- FULLEST HOUSE, FIVE OF A KIND, BIG STRAIGHT

**Rare (Uncommon):**
- FOUR OF A KIND, ALL LETTERS, STRAIGHT

**Uncommon (Regular wins):**
- DOUBLE TRIPLE, FULL HOUSE, THREE PAIR

**Common (Frequent wins):**
- THREE OF A KIND, TWO PAIR, ALL NUMBERS

### Expected Gameplay

**If you make 100 commits, you can expect:**
- ~35 no wins (-350 points)
- ~3 two pairs (+150 points)
- ~4 all numbers (+40 points)
- ~1 three of a kind (+50 points)
- Various rarer patterns adding up to roughly break even or slight positive

**Net result:** Slight positive expectation with high variance!

### Longest Expected Droughts

- **JACKPOT**: You'd need to commit ~46,000 times per day for 1,000 years to statistically see one
- **HEXTET**: ~440 commits per day for 1 year
- **LUCKY SEVEN**: ~6,850 commits per day for 1 year
- **FULLEST HOUSE**: ~88 commits per day for 1 year

### Fastest to Hit (statistically)

- **THREE OF A KIND**: Most common win, about 1 in 15 commits
- **ALL NUMBERS**: Break even, about 1 in 27 commits
- **TWO PAIR**: Should see one in your first 45 commits

### Commit Milestones

- **10 commits**: Likely seen some all numbers, maybe a two pair
- **100 commits**: Should have hit at least one two pair and three of a kind
- **1,000 commits**: Decent chance of seeing a four of a kind or straight
- **10,000 commits**: Good shot at a fullest house or five of a kind
- **100,000 commits**: Might see a hextet if you're lucky
- **1,000,000 commits**: JACKPOT is still astronomically unlikely

### House Edge

- **Cost per play:** 10 points
- **Expected return:** ~10+ points
- **House edge:** Slight player advantage (balanced for fun!)
- **Standard deviation:** High variance (big wins are rare but huge)

## Pattern Detection Details

### Consecutive Pairs
TWO PAIR and THREE PAIR require consecutive identical characters:
- `aabb1cd` = TWO PAIR âœ“ (pairs are `aa` and `bb`)
- `a1b2abc` = NO WIN âœ— (a's and b's are separated)

### Straights
Must be sequential hex values (can be ascending or descending):
- `0123456` = LUCKY SEVEN âœ“
- `fedcba9` = LUCKY SEVEN âœ“
- `012abc3` = NO WIN âœ—

### Frequency Patterns
Based on character counts:
- Three of a kind beats scattered pairs
- Full house beats three of a kind
- Pattern priority is checked from rarest to most common

*Note: Actual probabilities are approximate. Pattern detection checks in order of rarity, so higher-value patterns take precedence.*

## How It Works

1. **Install the hook**: `git-slot-machine init` adds a post-commit hook to your repo
2. **Make commits**: Every time you commit, the hook runs automatically
3. **Get results**: See your pattern, payout, and updated balance immediately
4. **Sync globally**: Your plays sync to gitslotmachine.com (if authenticated)
5. **Compete**: Climb the leaderboards and build win streaks!

### Privacy & Data

The CLI sends the following data to the server when authenticated:
- Commit hash (first 7 chars + full hash)
- Repository information (URL, owner, name)
- GitHub username
- Pattern detected and payout

Your balance is tracked both locally and on the server. You can disable syncing anytime:
```bash
git-slot-machine config set sync-enabled false
```
