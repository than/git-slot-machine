## [1.3.2] - 2025-01-16

### Added
- **Organization vs personal credit choice** during `init` command
  - Choose whether commits should be credited to your personal username or the repo's organization
  - Per-repo configuration stored locally in `.git/slot-machine-config.json`
  - Prompt only appears when repo owner differs from your personal username
  - Perfect for company repos (credit the org) or personal projects (credit yourself)

### Changed
- `getGitHubUsername()` now checks for per-repo override before falling back to global username
- Added `playAsUsername` field to config interface for per-repo identity

### Improved
- More flexible identity management for developers working across personal and organizational repos
- Each repository can have its own credit preferences

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-16

### Changed
- Hidden `config:get` and `config:set` from default help output (dev/advanced only)
- Updated `init` command to show new `sync:disable` command instead of old syntax

### Improved
- Cleaner help output focusing on user-facing commands
- Advanced commands still available but don't clutter common workflows

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-16

### Changed
- **Simplified command structure**: Adopted Laravel/Artisan-style `resource:action` pattern
  - `git-slot-machine config set sync-enabled false` → `git-slot-machine sync:disable`
  - `git-slot-machine config set sync-enabled true` → `git-slot-machine sync:enable`
  - Added `git-slot-machine username:set <username>` for easier username changes
  - Kept `config:get` and `config:set` for advanced configuration

### Improved
- More intuitive command structure following industry-standard patterns
- Shorter, more memorable commands for common operations
- Better command discoverability with resource-based organization

## [1.2.4] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- Fixed `init` command to continue setup even when post-commit hook already exists
- Now completes username setup, privacy mode, and leaderboard opt-in when hook exists
- Shows instructions for manually integrating with existing hooks instead of aborting

## [1.2.3] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- Fixed postinstall script dependency issue - now uses ANSI codes instead of chalk
- Postinstall message now displays correctly on global install

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- Fixed postinstall script not showing on global install
- Removed overly strict global install detection that prevented message from displaying

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- Added `-v` shorthand for `--version` flag
- Updated hardcoded version from 0.1.0 to 1.2.1

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-16

### Breaking Changes
- **Simplified command structure**: Authentication commands moved to top-level
  - `git-slot-machine auth login <username>` → `git-slot-machine login <username>`
  - `git-slot-machine auth status` → `git-slot-machine status`
  - `git-slot-machine auth logout` → `git-slot-machine logout`

### Added
- **Automatic GitHub username detection** during init with smart fallback chain:
  - GitHub CLI (`gh`) authentication
  - Git config `github.user`
  - GitHub noreply email pattern
  - Manual prompt as fallback
- **Opt-in leaderboard prompt** during init - users choose whether to join
- **Postinstall script** with setup instructions (global installs only)

### Changed
- GitHub username now stored globally (not per-repo) as it represents developer identity
- Init flow now prompts to join leaderboard with username confirmation
- Authentication is now optional but encouraged during setup

### Improved
- Clearer onboarding experience with guided prompts
- Better username detection reduces manual entry
- More intuitive command structure (no nested `auth` subcommand)

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-16

### Improved
- Enhanced privacy mode messaging with visual indicators (✓ and ✗) to clearly show what data is and isn't sent to the server
- Privacy mode now displays a red X for repository details that are NOT sent
- Public mode shows all items with green checkmarks

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-16
